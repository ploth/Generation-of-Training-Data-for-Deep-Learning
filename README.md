# Generation of Training Data for Deep Learning 

This repository aims to give an overview of different techniques for the
generation of training data for deep learning procedures. Inspired by the
[3D-Machine-Learning overview by
timzhang642](https://github.com/timzhang642/3D-Machine-Learning#material_synthesis)
this list is created while working on my master thesis.
